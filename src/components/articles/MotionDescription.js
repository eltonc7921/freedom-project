			Newton's first law of motion<br/>
			A body at rest will remain at rest and a body in motion will remain in motion unless acted upon an external force<br/>
			<br/>
			Newton's second law of motion<br/>
			F = ma, Force = mass * acceleration<br/>
			<br/>
			Newton's third law of motion<br/>
			When a body exerts a force on another body, that other body excerts an opposite force of the same magnitude<br/>
		</p>
		<p>
			Although simple, these three laws are the building blocks of a large part of physics.<br/>
